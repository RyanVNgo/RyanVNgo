Current undergraduate at San Diego State University (2025).
Recently messing around with C/C++ alongside CUDA. Also familiar with Java, Python, and a bit of Go.
Interested in software/program optimization cause I hate it when shits slow. 
Outside of programming I'm also into tech, gaming, coffee, astrophotography, and K-pop. <sub>*(stan Aespa)*</sub>

#### Some Takes
- learn by writing code, *read/watch/ask when you need to*
- read the documentation, *you'll probably find what you need there*
- write documentation, *it's not that hard and actually helpful*
- keep it simple, *context dependent - just don't overthink it*
- OOP is fine, *don't force it and you won't fuck it up*
- AI is nice for asking, *not for copying*
- Performance matters, *your computer is nice, others are probably not*
