I do computer stuff, mostly writing code, documentation is nice too.

A recent Computer Science graduate from San Diego State University interested in building
high-performance, high-quality software with clean, maintainable, well-documented code.

Outside of programming I like tech, gaming, coffee, astrophotography, F1ðŸšœ, and K-pop. <sub>*(stan Aespa)*</sub>
